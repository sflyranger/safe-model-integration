# Code Security Review Checklist for Loading External Models

When using models with `trust_remote_code=True`, especially from third-party sources, it's crucial to ensure the code is safe. This flag allows custom Python code from the model repository to run on your system, which can pose significant security risks if not properly reviewed.

## Key Areas to Inspect

### 1. Suspicious Imports
Be cautious of imports that can interact with the system, network, or file system:

```python
import os
import subprocess
import socket
import shutil
import requests
```

**Why?** These libraries can execute shell commands, access files, or send data externally.

### 2. File System Access
Check for any file system interactions:

```python
os.system("command")
subprocess.run("command")
open("/path/to/file", "r")
shutil.rmtree("/directory")
```

**Why?** Such operations can delete, modify, or access sensitive files.

### 3. Network Requests
Review code that makes network calls:

```python
requests.get("http://example.com")
urllib.request.urlopen("http://example.com")
socket.connect(("example.com", 80))
```

**Why?** This can download malicious content or exfiltrate data.

### 4. Dynamic Code Execution
Be extremely cautious with dynamic execution:

```python
eval("code")
exec("command")
```

**Why?** These functions can run arbitrary code, which may be hidden or obfuscated.


### 5. Hidden or Obfuscated Code
Look for unclear or obfuscated function names and variables:

```python
def lIlI1I():
    pass
```

**Why?** Obfuscation may hide malicious behavior or backdoors.

### 6. Accessing Environment Variables
Check for access to environment variables:

```python
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
```

**Why?** This can expose sensitive credentials.

### 7. Hardcoded URLs or IP Addresses
Watch for hardcoded URLs or IP addresses:

```python
url = "http://malicious-site.com"
```

**Why?** These may be used for data exfiltration or downloading malicious scripts.


## Best Practices for Verification

1. **Clone the Repository Locally**

   Review the code safely by downloading it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://huggingface.co/your-model-repo
   ```

2. **Use Automated Code Scanning Tools**

   Tools like `bandit`, `pylint`, or `flake8` can detect vulnerabilities:
   ```bash
   pip install bandit
   bandit -r .
   ```

3. **Search for Suspicious Patterns**

   Use `grep` to find potentially dangerous code:
   ```bash
   grep -r "os.system" .
   grep -r "requests.get" .
   grep -r "eval(" .
   ```

4. **Manual Code Review**

   Review files like `modeling.py` or `tokenization.py` for unexpected functionality.
